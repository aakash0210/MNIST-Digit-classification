# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification with PyTorch
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## OVERVIEW
This Code provides a step-by-step guide to:

1. Data Loading: Downloading and loading the MNIST dataset using PyTorch's torchvision.datasets.

2. Model Definition: Defining a CNN architecture for image classification using PyTorch's torch.nn.Module.2.

3. Training: Implementing the training loop to train the model using the loaded dataset.

4. Testing: Evaluating the trained model on a separate test dataset to measure its performance.

5. Configuration: Configuring hyperparameters and settings for training and testing.

## DEPENDENCIES
* Python 3
* PyTorch
* Matplotlib
* torchvision


## USAGE
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aakash0210/MNIST-Digit-classification.git
 ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd MNIST-Digit-classification
 ```
3. Open and run the MNIST.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.

4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train and test the CNN model.

## NOTES
- Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```
- Feel free to adjust hyperparameters, network architecture, or any other aspects of the code to experiment with different configurations.
