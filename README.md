# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification with PyTorch
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## OVERVIEW
This Code provides a step-by-step guide to:

Data Loading: Downloading and loading the MNIST dataset using PyTorch's torchvision.datasets.
Model Definition: Defining a CNN architecture for image classification using PyTorch's torch.nn.Module.
Training: Implementing the training loop to train the model using the loaded dataset.
Testing: Evaluating the trained model on a separate test dataset to measure its performance.
Configuration: Configuring hyperparameters and settings for training and testing.

## DEPENDENCIES
Python 3,
PyTorch,
Matplotlib,
torchvision.

## USAGE
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/aakash0210/MNIST-Digit-classification.git

Navigate to the repository directory:
cd mnist-cnn

Open and run the MNIST_CNN.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.

Follow the instructions within the notebook to train and test the CNN model.

## NOTES
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib

Feel free to adjust hyperparameters, network architecture, or any other aspects of the code to experiment with different configurations.
